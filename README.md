- `npm install` - This will download dependencies
- `npm start` — This will spawn a development server with a default port of `1234`.
- `npm run build` — This will output a production build in the `dist` directory.

## The Challenge:

We are looking to build an inventory system for storing shoes. We will need a web interface to do this. Please follow the instructions below and create a fairly simple inventory system.

Create a web interface using React.js

We will need a 5x5 grid to display the inventory shelf, each slot should show which shoe is placed in it.

When a spot is clicked, we should be prompted to add, edit, or remove the shoe that is currently in that slot.

We will need a form with the following fields for a shoe ( all generic text fields) 
- Brand
- Style
- Size
- UPC ID
